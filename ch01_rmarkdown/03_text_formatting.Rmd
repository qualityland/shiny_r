# Level 1 Heading

This is a sentence. Any text here gets rendered as normal text.

A blank line creates a new paragraph, still in the same section.

# Another Level 1 Heading

More text.

## Level 2 Heading

This is a subsection under the level 1 heading.

# Back to Level 1

This starts a new section.

# Text Formatting

This is all done using Underscores `_`:

_italic_ 

__bold__

___italic and bold___

Does it look the same when we use asterix instead?

*italic*

**bold**

***italic and bold***

Yes, it does!
